Salmon Cookies Stores
As a user, I want a webpage that displays individual store data for my Salmon Cookie Shops, so that I can be informed about how to run my business
As a developer, I want to represent the store data in a list format on the webpage, so my client can view the information
As a developer, I want to use object-oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand
As a developer, I want to implement a constructor function, so that I can reuse code and eliminate much of the duplication in my JavaScript
As a user, I want cookie sales data represented in tables rather than lists
As a developer, to demonstrate to my client my ability to add value, I will create a second table that will help Pat manage staffing. Using the basic rubric that single Salmon Cookie Tosser can serve 20 customers per hour, and that each location should have a minimum of two Salmon Cookie Tossers on shift at all times, calculate how many Salmon Cookie Tossers are needed at each location each hour.
As a user, I want to model my projected sales data as accurately as possible. Research into Patâ€™s customer traffic has shown that the hours of 8am, 11am, and 3pm tend to have more customers than other hours, and that the hours with the least customers are 1pm and 6pm. Apply a control curve to the projected sales numbers to reflect those daily ebbs and flows. The following array represents the percentage of maximum traffic that occurs during each of the hours from 6am to 8pm, and can be used to scale the projected hourly customer traffic into more accurate values:[0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 0.7, 0.4, 0.6, 0.9, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6]
